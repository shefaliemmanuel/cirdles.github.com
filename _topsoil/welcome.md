Topsoil is a desktop application and Java library that creates data visualizations for geochronologists and other earth scientists. The project is led and maintained by CIRDLES, an undergraduate research lab at the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina.

The name "Topsoil" is an anagram of "Isoplot", the name of an enormously successful Microsoft Excel Add-In with similar capabilities that now works only in older versions of Excel.
