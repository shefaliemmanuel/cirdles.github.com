The easiest way to import data into Topsoil is to copy and paste it into the data table. First, select and copy the data in Excel that you want to import. The selected data must contiguous (although omissions are allowed) and have no more than one row of headers.

The data may then be pasted into Topsoil either by using the paste shortcut (Ctrl-p or ⌘-p on Mac) or by pressing the paste button in the center of the empty table.
