From the Lab Data Manager you can import, create, and manage defined data models of data reduction parameters, such as for tracers, Pb and U fractionation, laboratory Pb blank and initial common Pb isotopic compositions, physical constants, mineral standards, and rare earth elements. ET_Redux saves the selected models with each sample file so they are available to anyone using ET_Redux to access the file. Just select *Lab Data* from the top menu of ET_Redux to manage your data models.
