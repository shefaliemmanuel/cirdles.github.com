The Report Settings Manager is available as the first item under the Reports menu.  The manager allows the user to customize the data tables produced by ET_Redux by choosing and ordering the categories, and choosing and ordering the columns within each category. To hide or show a single category or column, double-click it or use the hide/show button.  The show ALL or hide ALL buttons hide or show all of the elements at once. Each column can be customized relative to whether significant digits are used to format the numerical entries in the table.  Units of Ma or Ka are available for the Dates category.

The next two options on the Reports menu provide for Saving and Loading customized report settings as XML (extensible markup language) files.  The schema for report settings can be found <a href="https://github.com/EARTHTIME/Schema/tree/master/upbReports" target="_blank">here</a> for those readers interested in the details.  A note to users - from time-to-time the schema change to accommodate new features and may require re-customization of reports.

ET_Redux supports saving default report settings to customize your use of the software.  You can specify any saved report settings XML file as your default or use the <a href="http://earth-time.org" target="_blank">EARTHTIME</a> recommended default.

Finally, you can export data table reports as PDF, SVG, Excel, or CSV files.
