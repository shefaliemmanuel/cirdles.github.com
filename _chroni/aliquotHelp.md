An aliquot file is an XML file that contains data on a specifc rock sample. 
CHRONI uses report settings to display this data in an aliquot data table.

<b>Downloading</b><br>
When downloading aliquot files from <a href="http://geochron.org/detritalsearch.php" target="_blank">geochron</a>, simply type in the IGSN number into the download bar 
of the aliquot activity, then press the download button. To view this aliquot, you then need to open it
in the file browser by click the add button, selecting your aliquot, then pressing open. 
<br><br>
The other way to download an aliquot is by downloading it from outside of the app. When downloading outside 
of CHRONI, the aliquot file will be located in the download file of your device. CHRONI has a new import
 feature where you can click the file you want to pull files from and it will automatically pull aliquot 
 and report setting files and insert them into the correct CHRONI folders. This feature can be accessed 
 from the menu bar.
