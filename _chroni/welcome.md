Chroni is a mobile application that presents archived data downloaded from the Geochron database in a customizable format for use by geologists in the field. Currently, the Chroni application only works with Android devices. The project is led and maintained by CIRDLES, an undergraduate research lab at the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina.
