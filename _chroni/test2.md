1. Install our most recent CHRONI APK from our <a href="https://github.com/CIRDLES/CHRONI/releases" target="_blank">Releases</a>.
	* Note: if using a computer to download the APK, simply send the file to your device via email.
	* Select the application from the dropdown menu on your device and hit install.
2. In a location where your device receives internet connection, open the CHRONI application.
	* Internet connection is needed to initialize the application because the default Report Settings file must be fetched from <a href="https://cirdles.org" target="_blank">cirdles.org</a>.
3. Congratulations! Your CHRONI application is officially setup! Now, you can utilize the following features:
	* Open - View your aliquot in a custom format as specified by your current Report Settings file
	* History - Review your last ten aliquot files with the click of a button!
	* Profile - Specify your Geochron Portal account information in order to retrieve private aliquot files.
