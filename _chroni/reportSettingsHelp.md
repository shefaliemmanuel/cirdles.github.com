Report settings are XML files created through ET Redux in which the user specifies which data sets and units they would
like to display. The user can decide what columns appear, the amount of significant digits they would like to display, and more.

<br>
<b>Downloading</b><br>
To obtain custom report settings, the user needs to be sent report settings from colleagues or create their own through 
ET Redux. To access information about using ET Redux, click <a href="http://cirdles.org/projects/et_redux/#report-settings" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br>Once you have downloaded a report setting to your device, you can use the new import feature to put into CHRONI's file system.
Open up the CHRONI menu and then click on the import activity. Select the file you want to import from and click import and it
will simply transfer any report settings and/or aliquot files you have in that folder.
